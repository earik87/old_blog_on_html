This github project provides codes for my personal home-page built in HTML and CSS. It is deployed by using Github pages. 

## Problem

I always wanted to have a personal website to show my professional career and personality. Within CS50, I followed Web Track and learned a lot about HTML and CSS. Since I have a curiosity on front-end development, I decided to build on my own website.

## Solution

I built my website by using HTML and CSS. I benefited from bootstrap to build navigation bar which is located on the top of the website. 

## Tools 

* Visual Studio Code was used as an editor together with liveserver extension. This extension helps you to preview HTML website locally. 
* In order to use "Git" functionality of Visual Studio Code, make sure you have "git" installed.
* Github desktop application was used to push my changes to the repository. 
* To publish my website, Github pages was used, since it is free. 

## Todo

* Create blog articles on topics that I like to share information about.
