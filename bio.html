                    <p> I studied chemistry in the university and did 8 years of research as a master and phd student on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafast_laser_spectroscopy">ultrafast spectroscopy</a>.
                        This field is a multi-disciplinary field where physics, electronics, optics, chemistry and even biology coincide. It was a good opportunity to learn a lot about fundamental science. 
                        There is more information on my research background in <a href="research.html">here</a>.

                        In 2018, I moved into private sector as a software engineer. This was a dream of mine, and it turned into a reality.
                        I work at Infor since 2018, which is one of the top ERP software company in the world. 
                        I am involved in development and maintanance of Infor LN Finance product.
                    </p>

                        I am happily working as a software engineer and I have a motivation to become better at it. 
                        For this reason, in the begining of 2020, I decided to learn the fundamentals of computer science & programming.
                        Here I would like to touch on courses that I followed or still following.
